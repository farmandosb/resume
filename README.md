# My Resume Project with Rubric from Udacity tutorial
Review the Online Resume [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.189245867.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2962818615/rubric).

## Steps I follow to complete this tutorial

1. Modify the builder.js with my resume's info replacing the variable string values **%data%**, checking the **js/helper.js** and caring about the append or prepend method for add the element into my resume in the appropriate location of the **index.html**
2. Use the [Google Maps API key] for displaying a map.

Files in the repository:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: Info of my resume to show in the index.html
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: I have made few changes into to original style of the project.
